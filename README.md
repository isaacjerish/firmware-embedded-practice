# Firmware Coding Practice

This repo is a work-in-progress collection of embedded/firmware coding problems I'm using to prepare for firmware/embedded engineering interviews. The goal is simple: practice, learn, and improve my low-level coding skills—especially around bit manipulation, data structures, and memory management, which are crucial in embedded systems roles.

---

## What You'll Find Here

- Problem solutions focused on core firmware interview topics (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks/queues, bit manipulation, memory)
- Each problem is documented with the question included as a comment in the code
- A clear directory structure organizing problems and my answers
- Utility code to support embedded-style programming practice

## Important Notes

- This repo is very much a work in progress. Not all questions have been created or answered yet.
- My solutions are my own attempts and learning exercises; they are **not guaranteed to be optimal or the only way to solve the problem**.
- I'm open sourcing this to share my preparation process and to hold myself accountable, but I’m still learning and improving every day.
- This is primarily a personal practice repo, not a polished expert-level codebase. Use it as a reference, but don’t treat it like a definitive guide.
